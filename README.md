# Pixel-Art-Converter

This Python script uses Pygame to convert an image to pixel art.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Pygame (`pip install pygame`)


## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the Python script.
2. Replace `"farmers-market.jpg"` in the script with the path to your input image.
3. Adjust the `pixel_size` variable for the desired pixel size. It is set to 10 at default, smaller pixel size results in a more detailed image.
4. Run the script.

The converted pixel art will be displayed using Pygame.

## Additional Notes

- Make sure to have the necessary image file (example: `farmers-market.jpg`) in the specified location.
- Feel free to experiment with different parameters to achieve your preferred pixel art style.
